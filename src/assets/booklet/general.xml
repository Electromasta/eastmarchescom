In addition to these slots, characters carry for free one ration box, one waterskin, and one coin purse, enough for 5 days of travel and 100 coins. Some items potentially are even heavier than large on account of weight and/or bulkiness. For example, Leather armor takes up 4 slots, Medium armor takes up 6 slots, and Heavy armor takes up 8 spots. </text>
