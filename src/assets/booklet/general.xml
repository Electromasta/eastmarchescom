            </list>
        </subsection>
        <subsection>
            <header>Bash Skill (Strength)</header>
            <text>Your Strength (Bash) check covers situations where you would like to break or disable various structures.  Breaking simple locks, opening doors, bending bars, and even ‘disabling’ traps can be accomplished, depending on the material in question.  Failing a Bash check comes with an added liability of making locks and doors inoperable, and setting off traps you intended to disable.</text>
        </subsection>
        <subsection>
            <header>Disarm Action</header>
            <text>Using the Attack action, you can make a special melee attack to Disarm a creature, either to knock the weapon away from it or to sunder the item completely (beat the contest by 10). If you're able to make multiple attacks with the Attack action, this attack replaces one of them.
                The target of your disarm must be no more than one size larger than you, and it must be within your reach. You make a Strength (Bash) check contested by the target's Strength (Bash) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check (the target chooses the ability to use). You succeed automatically if the target is incapacitated. If you succeed, you knock the weapon 10 feet away from you, or sunder if you beat the contest by 10.  A Sundered Weapon cannot be used until it is fixed.

                Special:  To sunder a magical item, the item in question must also be magical of an equal bonus or higher.  A +1 flametongue longsword cannot sunder a +2 dagger.

            <text>When two humanoids are on opposite sides of another humanoid, the other humanoid is considered 'flanked' and has -2 AC vs melee attacks.</text>
        </subsection>
		<subsection>
            <header>Westmarches 'can become lost' clause</header>
            <text>Any time a feature states that a character cannot be lost, you should replace it with the following: When you are in the wilderness, you can at any time retrace your steps exactly the way you came, until you return to the Town. Once you return to the Town, this ability resets.</text>
